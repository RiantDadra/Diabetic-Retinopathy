# Diabetic-Retinopathy
Diabetes mellitus can induce diabetic retinopathy (DR), a medical disorder that can harm the patient's retina and lead to blood clots. How long you've had diabetes, affects how quickly you acquire retinopathy.
Due to retinal vascular malfunctioning, there may initially be no symptoms or only a little amount of visual impairment. Regular eye exams are therefore essential to send the patient to a physician as soon as possible for a thorough eye examination and treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss. The importance of diabetic retinopathy screening programs and the difficulty in achieving a reliable early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy at a reasonable cost needs attention to develop computer-aided diagnosis tools, which could ease mass screening of population with diabetes mellitus and help clinicians in utilizing their time more efficiently. Artificial intelligence-based techniques have taken on DR analysis and detection in recent years. 
In order to train various machine learning models for detecting diabetic retinopathy, including ResNet, EffectientNet, DenseNet, InceptionNet, XceptionNet, ConvNeXtX, RegNet, MobileNet, NesNet, VGG19, and InceptionResNet, a systematic econometric literature analysis was conducted. Different sets of train images were fed to the models and the accuracy of each of the models was analyzed and compared.
